Clients are based on a file system which are all read-only.
The changes each client makes to it's file system are stored in a unique location on the server.
As new clients connect to the service a folder is automatically created for them on the server and the default file system is assigned to them.

Actions:
--------
<b>Edit</b>: Edit client settings, such as hostname, bootup command, etc.
<b>Clone</b>: Clones a clients file system make it available as a file system for other new clients.
  The client must be shutdown during a clone operaton.
<b>Purge</b>: Deletes all files the client has changed giving it a new fresh copy of it's base file system.
  The client must be shutdown during a purge operaton.
  You can also rebase the client to a different file system after the purge operation.
<b>Shutdown</b>: Shuts down the client.
<b>Reboot</b>: Reboots the client.
