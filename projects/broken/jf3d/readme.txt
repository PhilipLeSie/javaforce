An imcomplete 3D modeler.

Orginally I couldn't get blender to work.  It uses Z up while OpenGL uses Y up.  So I started
to create this 3D modeler.  But finally I got blender working, in the settings change rotation to
Trackball mode and use Y as up and it works fine.  Then just export to .3ds files using default settings.
So I stopped working on this modeler, but writing it did help find bugs in my GL framework.

For now all this app can do is load .3ds/.blend/.jf3d files and view them.  Might add more in the future if I'm bored...
