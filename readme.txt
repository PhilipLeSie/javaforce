Folders
=======
 /          - main folder (run ant here to build /src)
 /src       - the javaforce source files
 /jars      - 3rd party files
 /stubs     - native launcher stubs
 /native    - native JNI bindings for FFMPEG, OpenGL, Camera
 /classes   - javaforce compiled files
 /projects  - source for all sub-projects

Building
========
All projects are built with Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org).
Make sure to run ant in the main folder to build the /src folder and then in any of the apps in /projects.
If building on Windows make sure to copy /native/*.dll to /windows/system32 since some of the
build tools require them.

Common Ant tasks:
-----------------
compile : compile projects java files
jar : build the projects main jar file
depjars : copy dependant jar files into project folder
install : install files into proper folders (Linux only)
 - for the main JavaForce library you MUST specify -Dbits=32|64
 - requires root access
 - example : "sudo ant install -Dbits=32"
deb : build Ubuntu deb file (after install)
rpm : build Fedora rpm file (after install)
msi32 : build Windows msi file (32bit)
msi64 : build Windows msi file (64bit)
jremsi32 : build Windows msi file with JRE bundled (32bit)
jremsi64 : build Windows msi file with JRE bundled (64bit)
dmg : build Mac dmg file (mac only)
genisodmg : build Mac dmg file (cygwin/linux/mac) (uncompressed)
javadoc : create javadoc api help files (open ./javadoc/index.html)

Bundled JRE
-----------
To bundle the JRE with packages you must:
  - use Java 9 (project jigsaw)
  - run "ant jre" in main folder

Linux Repo
----------

ubuntu/debian:
  #download JavaForce Repo file
